First, consider the variance of BMI within each of these subpopulations using graphical techniques, and through the estimated subpopulation variances.  Then, calculate pooled and unpooled estimates of the standard error for the difference between the mean BMI in the two populations being compared.  Finally, test the null hypothesis that the two population means are equal, using each of the two different standard errors."
