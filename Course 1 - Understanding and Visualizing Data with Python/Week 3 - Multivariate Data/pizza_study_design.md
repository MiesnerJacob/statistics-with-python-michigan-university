SUBJECT: Hot Fire Pizza Study Design Proposal

This proposal is designed to help collect and summarize data to be used in Hot Fire Pizza's upcoming marketing campaign. The marketing campaign will feature comparison against our main competitor Cold Water Pizza. This plan includes what information will be measured, how it will be measured, and how it will be communicated to form actionable insights. 

**What we will measure (Research Questions)**

Within the past few years, Hot Fire Pizza and Cold Water Pizza have been locked in heated competition to own the growing Gotham City pizza market. In this research study we will look to answer three critical questions:

- What objectively measurable advantages does Hot Fire Pizza's product have over Cold Fire Pizza?
- Does our target audience prefer Hot Fire Pizza or Cold Fire pizza in taste, service, and overall satisfaction?
- What is our target audience's favorite attribute of both Hot Fire Pizza and Cold Fire Pizza?

**How we will measure it (Variables to Record)**

The following data collection processes need to be conducted:

- Record attributes of the pizzas themselves
- Survey target audience on their opinions

First, we will record the attributes of the pizzas from both Hot Fire Pizza and Cold Water Pizza. The attributes we will record include:

- the prices of the pizzas
- the amount of topping you can get
- the size of the pizzas
- weight of the pizzas

Next, we will conduct a survey of our target audience. This survey should include a random sample of one thousand people within our target audience and ask them the following questions about both Hot Fire Pizza and Cold Water Pizza:

- Rate taste of pizza (1-10)
- Rate customer service (1-10)
- Rate overall satisfaction (1-10)
- Favorite attribute of the pizza (multiple-choice, 5 answers)

**How we will extract actionable insights (Graphical & Numerical Summaries)**

First, we will highlight the measurable attributes where Hot Fire Pizza has an advantage over Cold Water Pizza. We will plot bar charts to communicate the size difference in price & toppings. For the size & weight of the pizzas, we can use infographics because these variables people strongly associate with the visual of the pizza itself.

Next, we will take the survey responses we collected to communicate whether or not our target audience prefers Hot Fire Pizza or Cold Fire Pizza in taste, service, and satisfaction. These three attributes are all on the same scale so we can plot the distribution of answers using a side-by-side box-plot. This box plot will show the distribution of survey responses for taste, service, and satisfaction across Hot Fire Pizza and Cold Fire Pizza. 

Finally, in order to communicate what the target audiences' favorite attributes of Hot Fire Pizza and Cold Water Pizza are we will plot a stacked bar chart that shows the relative frequency of each possible answer for both companies.
