    "\n",
    "As discussed in week one of this course,  we will be investigating how to develop various statistical models around data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling plays a significant role in data analysis and builds upon fundamental concepts of statistics.  By fitting models to data we are able to accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Estimate__ distributional properties of variables, potentially conditional on other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concisely __summarize relationships__ between variables, and make inferential statements about those relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Predict__ values of variables of interest conditional on values of other predictor varialbes, and characterize prediction uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these concepts in mind, we will overview modeling structure and carrying out exploratory data analysis on a dataset that contains information about homes in Boston, MA and how we may want to approach modeling prices of homes.\n",

When a consumer is looking to buy a house, its good practice to cross-examine the price of a potential home with the going rate of the market to ensure you aren't overpaying.  Modeling this data would enable a consumer to ensure a home is within the ballpark price range of similar homes in the area.\n",

    "Next, we define our independent variables or predictors.  Predictors are typically chosen based on their perceived relationship to our primary variable on interest, or price of home.  For example,  our gut instinct tells us that the number of rooms (variable __RM__ in our dataset) would greatly impact the price of a home becasue it implies more square-footage.  Additionally, we may want to consider crime rate (variable __CRIM__ in our dataset) as a proxy for the quality of the neighboorhood the home resides in.  \n",
