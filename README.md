# statistics-with-python-michigan-university
A 3 course series offered by Michigan University which covers statistics and applying it through code. This specialization is designed to teach learners beginning and intermediate concepts of statistical analysis using the Python programming language. I am taking this course as a means of reaffirming and strengthening my knowledge base in statistics. 

## Course 1 - Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python
This course introduced the field of statistics, including where data come from, study design, data management, and exploring and visualizing data. Learners will identify different types of data, and learn how to visualize, analyze, and interpret summaries for both univariate and multivariate data. Learners will also be introduced to the differences between probability and non-probability sampling from larger populations, the idea of how sample estimates vary, and how inferences can be made about larger populations based on probability sampling.

##  Course 2 - Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python
This course explores basic principles behind using data for estimation and for assessing theories. We will analyze both categorical data and quantitative data, starting with one population techniques and expanding to handle comparisons of two populations. We will learn how to construct confidence intervals. We will also use sample data to assess whether or not a theory about the value of a parameter is consistent with the data. A major focus will be on interpreting inferential results appropriately.  

##  Course 3 - Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python
This course expands our exploration of statistical inference techniques by focusing on the science and art of fitting statistical models to data. We will build on the concepts presented in the Statistical Inference course (Course 2) to emphasize the importance of connecting research questions to our data analysis methods. We will also focus on various modeling objectives, including making inference about relationships between variables and generating predictions for future observations.
